I'm Matheus, I'm currently (and hopefully will always be) 22 years old and I'm a hands-on, software engineer with industry experience developing desktop applications. I have comprehensive knowledge about Agile Methodologies and programming architectures. I once was a Desktop application lover, but boy-oh-boy the web development environment got me good!\
I'm now learning Laravel (consequently PHP and Mix too) together with HTML5, Javascript ES6+, React, and also Tailwindcss and Sass.
