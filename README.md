# Hey-o! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Matheus, I'm currently 26 years old and I'm a hands-on, software engineer with industry experience developing desktop applications. I have comprehensive knowledge about Agile Methodologies and programming architectures. I once was a Desktop application lover, but boy-oh-boy the web development environment got me good! But I still have thorough knowledge of .NET and .NET Core.

## Projects
### Haze
##### [Front-end](https://github.com/MatheusSw/haze-front-end) - [Back-end](https://github.com/MatheusSw/haze-monitoring)
###### _Work in progress_
##### Description
Haze is a plataform where you can manage and monitor your plant's environment, like temperature, humidity, and more.

##### Technologies used
- **Back end**, I had the chance to build a serverless infraestructure with AWS Lambda, DynamoDb, Api Gateway, SNS and an ESP32 for environment monitoring (temperature and humidity). I learned A LOT about DynamoDb and designed my own "schema" by defining my access patterns and analyzing my needs, also learned about how powerful and useful SNS can be.
- **On the front end**, the usual React with tailwindcss, and react router.

### Apollo Fm
##### [Repository](https://github.com/MatheusSw/apollo-fm-frontend)
###### _Work in progress_
##### Description
Apollo Fm is a plataform where you can connect your Last.fm (and in the future spotify account), generate reports based on your music taste and share them with your twitter followers.

##### Technologies used
- **On the back end**, I had the chance to build a serverless infraestructure with AWS Lambda, Route53 for the hosting, System Manager for secret storing (both encrypted and unencrypted), and RDS with MySql as the database. I'm really happy with this as I had the chance to really understand a lot more about AWS, even though I haven't used all of its resources.  
- **front end**, I got the chance to use React, React Rematch for my Redux store, and Tailwindcss for all my css. I got the chance to learn a lot about Redux and finally felt comfortable while working with responsive design and how to properly lay-out my components.

### [Ticketier](https://github.com/MatheusSw/Ticketier)
###### _This project was dropped due to lack of time_
##### Description
Ticketier goal is to make handling support tickets something easy. I found that in my previous work experiencies we always had an internal ticket handling system and they were always either super slow or untuitive, so Ticketier goal was to offer a more modern experience to that.

##### Technologies used
- **Back end**, just Laravel with Blade, using MySql as the database.
- **Front end**, React with tailwindcss.
### [Fruit recognizer](https://github.com/MatheusSw/Fruit-Recognizer)
##### Description
This one is pretty straight forward, it's an attempt to make an AI that recognizes fruits! The repository README speaks for itself.
##### Technologies used
Tensorflow and Python and the Fruits-360 Dataset, I learned a lot with this project, like how LSTM and GRU layers work.
